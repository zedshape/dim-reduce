# Multivariate Time Series Classification with Enhanced Interpretability

This repository contains code for implementing novel methods to enhance the interpretability of multivariate time series classification models. The proposed methods include Dimension Selection based on Segmentation of Time Series (DST) and Feature Selection based on Discretization Similarity (FDS). This is currently submitted to KDD workshop on Human-Interpretable AI.

### Features
- DST: Segments time series data and applies dimension selection to each segment to capture distinct properties across different time ranges.
- FDS: Reduces feature redundancy by comparing discretization techniques and eliminating those with similar bin boundaries.

### Script
- To reproduce the experiment, please run ZTime_Dimensionailty.py.
